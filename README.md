‚ö†Ô∏è Note: I solved the following challenges: **Discord, OSINT 1, OSINT 2, OSINT 3, Brr v1, Orcam, Rogue Poller, Register Sweep, Simple Protocol**. Between traveling and the CTF, I didn‚Äôt manage to collect all files for full writeups. So for now, only 3 OSINT challenges and Discord are properly documented. The Discord one is more of a bonus, showing how modern CTFs sneak in subtle traps rather than giving flags in plain text.
