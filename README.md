‚ö†Ô∏è Note: I solved the following challenges: **Discord, OSINT 1, OSINT 2, OSINT 3, Brr v1, Orcam, Rogue Poller, Register Sweep, Simple Protocol**. Got busy with other work during/after the CTF, so didn‚Äôt grab all the files for full writeups. My teammates solved additional challenges as well, but they were busy and couldn‚Äôt write full writeups. For now, only 3 OSINT challenges and Discord are properly documented. The Discord one is more of a bonus, showing how modern CTFs sneak in subtle traps rather than giving flags in plain text.
